  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Simulated and visualized spacecraft mission trajectories
    using NASA GMAT, focusing on orbital mechanics and trajectory design. 
    The project explores spacecraft motion, transfer orbits, and mission 
    sequencing to understand real-world astrodynamics and space mission planning.

  <h2>Innovation & Contribution</h2>
  <p>
   I designed a trajoectory that satellites can use to save fuel costs, since 
    the Moon's gravity will be used as a slingshot along the way to reach the
    desired place.

  <h2>Engineering Thought Process</h2>
  <p>
    My thinking process was iterative and exploratory. I started with
    simple Earth-centered orbits to build intuition, then gradually introduced
    more complexity such as transfers and multi-body effects. Many of the 
    early simulations did not behave as expected, which forced me to slow down 
    and question my assumptions about reference frames, propagation settings, and
    maneuver timing. Over time, this trial-and-error approach helped me connect mathematical 
    orbital mechanics with real spacecraft behavior, turning GMAT from a simulation tool 
    into a way of thinking about space missions.
