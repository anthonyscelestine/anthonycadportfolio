  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project focuses on the conceptual design and CAD development of a
    toroidal propeller aimed at reducing tip vortices, acoustic noise, and
    improving wake efficiency for UAV propulsion systems.

  <h2>Innovation & Contribution</h2>
  <p>
    Toroidal Propellers have been a topic of discussion in many fields except military,
    where I personally believed toroidal propellers will truly fuflfil their purpose.
    I worked on integrating toroidal propellers into military UAVs for improved
    stealth, which would massively benefit clandestine operations

  <h2>Engineering Thought Process</h2>
  <p>
    If there is one factor that must be considered when building a military UAV, 
    is stealth. Any UAV with the conventional blade propellers can be easily
    detected because of the noise they make due to tiny disturbances of air called 
    vortices that form in the sharp ends. What's the best way to remove these 
    vortices? Make sure you have no sharp ends. And what's the best shape with
    the least sharp edges while still be aerodynamically ideal? A toroid. After
    experimental validation it was clear that 3 toroids are necessary to create
    one propeller for the most efficient performance.
